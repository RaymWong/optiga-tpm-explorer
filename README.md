# OPTIGA™ TPM 2.0 Explorer

The OPTIGA™ TPM 2.0 Explorer is a GUI-based tool for users to familiarize themselves with TPM 2.0 quickly and easily using Infineon's OPTIGA™ TPM 2.0 solution for Raspberry Pi. In addition, the OPTIGA™ TPM 2.0 Explorer demonstrates how the OPTIGA™ TPM 2.0 can be used to increase security and trust for data sharing across different networking and cloud platforms.

Using this tool, you can instantly experience the benefits that [OPTIGA™ TPM 2.0](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/security-smart-card-solutions/optiga-embedded-security-solutions/optiga-tpm/?redirId=39899/) will bring to IoT devices and network equipment.
